        <p>The former congressman Steve Israel was tasked Friday with advising the Long Island counties on how to coordinate
        nonprofits helping federal workers who are unpaid because of the government’s partial shutdown, now at Day 35 and
        counting.</p>
        
        <p>Israel, a Democrat who served 16 years in the U.S. House of Representatives, is to lead a bi-county "working group”
        examining the local impact of the shutdown, Nassau County Executive Laura Curran and Suffolk County Executive Steve
        Bellone said.</p>
        <p>Israel, 61, said he wants to help cut through red tape.</p>
        <p>"Right now, everybody is doing something to help furloughed employees," he said. "The problem is that not everybody
        knows what anybody else is doing."</p>
        <p>He said he would gather government representatives at all levels with charities and social-service agencies to
        streamline the process of helping the workers.</p>
        <p>“It’s scattershot right now," Israel said, adding: “We just want to make sure that it’s efficient and well known.”
        </p>
        <p>The county executives made the appointment at the Theodore Roosevelt Legislative and Executive Building in Mineola, the
        seat of Nassau County.</p>
        <p>"We can no longer just simply sit back and rely on the federal government to do what they’re supposed to do on a daily
        basis," Bellone said.</p>

          <p>"Saturday Night Live" cast member Pete Davidson performed a late-night set Wednesday night before a sold-out crowd at
          Governor's comedy club in Levittown.</p>
          <p>Last year was a rough one for the comedian. His whirlwind engagement to pop star Ariana Grande ended apruptly, and he
          posted an ominous message on his Instagram account last month saying that he no longer wanted “to be on this earth.”</p>
          <p>However, 2019 seems to be looking up.</p>
          <p>Davidson, 25, has roles in several upcoming films (“What Men Want,” “Going Places,” “Big Time Adolescence”) and judging by his performance at Governor’s, his stand-up career is taking off.</p>
          <p>After four opening acts, Davidson took the stage well after 11 p.m. in pajamas and an oversized sweatshirt, holding a Bud Light in one hand and an e-cigarette in the other. “So,” he said casually. “Here we are.”</p>
          <p>Most of his material was blue, ranging from pedophilia to doing drugs with friends to giving sex advice to his gay buddies. He even discussed the supposed cocaine habits of his late father, a New York City firefighter who was killed on 9/11.</p>
          <p>“I always knew my Dad was a hero,” he said. “But I didn’t know he was a super hero.”</p>
          <p>Davidson, who announced during a 2017 “SNL” segment on "Weekend Update" that he had been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, joked heavily about others with disabilities.</p>
