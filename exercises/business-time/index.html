        and got a taste for murder. After the avalanche, it took us a week to climb out. Now, I don't know exactly when we
        turned on each other, but I know that seven of us survived the slide... and only five made it out. Now we took an
        oath, that I'm breaking now. We said we'd say it was the snow that killed the other two, but it wasn't. Nature is
        lethal but it doesn't hold a candle to man. </p>
      
      <p>You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves like it has a mind. Like it knows it killed the world once

      <p>Now that we know who you are, I know who I am. I'm not a mistake! It all makes sense! In a comic, you know how you
        can tell who the arch-villain's going to be? He's the exact opposite of the hero. And most times they're friends,
        like you and me! I should've known way back when... You know why, David? Because of the kids. <a href="#">They called me Mr.
        Glass.</a> </p>

      <p>Your bones don't break, mine do. That's clear. Your cells react to bacteria and viruses differently than mine. You
        don't get sick, I do. That's also clear. But for some reason, you and I react the exact same way to water. <span class="bold">We swallow
        it too fast, we choke.</span> We get some in our lungs, we drown. However unreal it may seem, we are connected, you and I.
        We're on the same curve, just on opposite ends. </p>
