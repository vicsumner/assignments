        <p>It moves like it has a mind. Like it knows it killed the world once
        and got a taste for murder. After the avalanche, it took us a week to climb out. Now, I don't know exactly when we
        turned on each other, but I know that seven of us survived the slide... and only five made it out. Now we took an
        oath, that I'm breaking now. We said we'd say it was the snow that killed the other two, but it wasn't. Nature is
        lethal but it doesn't hold a candle to man. </p>
      
      <p>The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men.
      Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is
      truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and
      furious anger those who would attempt to poison and destroy My brothers. And you will know My name is the Lord when I
      lay My vengeance upon thee. </p>
      
      <p>Now that we know who you are, I know who I am. I'm not a mistake! It all makes sense! In a comic, you know how you
        can tell who the arch-villain's going to be? He's the exact opposite of the hero. And most times they're friends,
        like you and me! I should've known way back when... You know why, David? Because of the kids. <a href="#">They called me Mr.
        Glass.</a> </p>

      <p>"My money's in that office, right? If she start giving me some BS about it ain't there, and we got to go someplace else and get it, I'm gonna shoot you in the head then and there. Then I'm gonna shoot that guy in the kneecaps, find
      out where my damn money is. She gonna tell me too. Hey, look at me when I'm talking to you, man. You
      listen: we go in there, and that guy Winston or anybody else is in there, you the first man to get shot. You understand?"</p>
