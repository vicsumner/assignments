        <p>It moves like it has a mind. Like it knows it killed the world once
          and got a taste for murder. After the avalanche, it took us a week to climb out. Now, I don't know exactly when
          we
          turned on each other, but I know that seven of us survived the slide... and only five made it out. Now we took an
          oath, that I'm breaking now. We said we'd say it was the snow that killed the other two, but it wasn't. Nature is
          lethal but it doesn't hold a candle to man. </p>
    
        <p>The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil
          men.
          Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for
          he is
          truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance
          and
          furious anger those who would attempt to poison and destroy My brothers. And you will know My name is the Lord
          when I
          lay My vengeance upon thee. </p>
    
        <p>Now that we know who you are, I know who I am. I'm not a mistake! It all makes sense! In a comic, you know how
          you
          can tell who the arch-villain's going to be? He's the exact opposite of the hero. And most times they're friends,
          like you and me! I should've known way back when... You know why, David? Because of the kids. <a href="#">They
            called me Mr.
            Glass.</a> </p>
